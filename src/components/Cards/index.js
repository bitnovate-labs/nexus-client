// This index.js file created inside the Cards directory allows you to centralize exports, making imports cleaner and more manageable throughout the project
// For example, if you export multiple components from this Cards folder, you can import them elsewhere as:
// import { TestCard1, TestCard2, TestCard3 } from './Cards'

export { default as ListCard } from "./ListCard";
export { default as ProfileCard } from "./ProfileCard";
